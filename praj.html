          Guitar, plucked stringed musical instrument that probably originated
          in Spain early in the 16th century, deriving from the guitarra latina,
          a late-medieval instrument with a waisted body and four strings. The
          early guitar was narrower and deeper than the modern guitar, with a
          less pronounced waist. It was closely related to the vihuela, the
          guitar-shaped instrument played in Spain in place of the lute.
